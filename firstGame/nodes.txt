/origin/null/You are sitting Mr. Cesarotti in class one day, when the tyrannical Zombie Purpleberg bashes her way through the supposedly ‘bulletproof’ window. ‘Brains’ she gargles maniacally, you think it’s normal at first, but then she tears a layer of flesh from Cesarotti neck, he yells ‘Remember that Project 7 is still due next week’. You think you’re safe for a moment until Purpleberg sets her eyes onto you. You attempt to run away, only to stumble on your own backpack. Mr. Beaver, in the background is being torn to shreds but still takes the time to say, ‘I told you to put away your backpack’. Just in the nick of time, your classmate Joe beats in Purpleberg's head with a desk. Mark, your other classmate appears behind Joe with a knife. ‘Let’s get out of here’ They both reach a hand out to you/Go with Joe/Go with Mark/1/2/

/one/null/Joe has assembled a team of your classmates, Josh, Nathan, and Lena. You all manage to escape the Tequila Hawaiian High School and into the parking lot. ‘My car is almost out of Gas’ Says Josh. ‘But if you give me ten minutes I could hotwire that yellow hummer’/Take Josh’s Car/Let him hotwire the hummer/3/4/

/two/null/Mark has assembled a team of your classmates Mat, Jonathan, Sarah, and Hadas. You all stay inside Tequilla Hawaiian High School and look at the news online (although the internet takes about 3 hours to load the video), and the news is morbid. The entire world has been overrun by Zombies. Mark decides that it is best to stay inside, so you barricade all the entrances. ‘There could still be survivors at the Moshmann Family JCC, should we try to help?’/Look for survivors/ Stay at THHS (Tequila High)/5/6/

/three/You all cram inside Josh’s BMW, everything goes smoothly for a while until you inevitably run out of gas on the bay bridge. A horde of zombies catches up with you, Josh sighs with frustration, ‘I have some fireworks in the back of my car, I’ll distract them while you guys get away’./Let Josh sacrifice himself/Distract the Zombies yourself/7/666/
